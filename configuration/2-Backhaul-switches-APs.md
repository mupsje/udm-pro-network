# Backhaul physical network

CAT5e cabling between the UDM to the managed switches and Unifi access points creates the
physical backbone of the network:

The cabling between UDM, switches and the APs are all part of the untagged, native LAN.
Since that portion of the network carries multiple VLANs, it's also referred to as *trunked connections*.

All managed Unifi switches and Unifi Access Points acquire their IP address via DHCP.
